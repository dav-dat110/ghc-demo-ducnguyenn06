Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

## Reflection

One technique I found especially useful was adding a **table of contents** in Quarto. It makes long webpages much easier to navigate and gives the reader a clear overview of each section. I can see myself using this feature in the final project so viewers can jump directly to specific parts of my analysis instead of scrolling endlessly. Using a TOC also helps me think about the *hierarchy* of my sections and how to structure my arguments clearly.

Another tip I enjoyed experimenting with was customizing the **theme**. Being able to switch between `light` and `dark` modes adds personality to the webpage and improves readability for different users. I learned how simple it is to change the appearance by editing the YAML header and adding a few lines of code. For my final project, I plan to choose a clean theme that matches the tone of my topic and ensures visual consistency across all pages.

Finally, I liked working with **callout blocks**, especially the collapsible one. Callouts help emphasize key points or warnings without cluttering the main text. I can imagine using a `callout-important` section in my final project to highlight limitations or data caveats, and maybe a `callout-tip` for notes on how others could reproduce my analysis. This feature makes the webpage feel more interactive and professional.
